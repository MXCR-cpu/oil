## 📦 Installation
First, if you haven't, download the pock app.
```sh
brew install --cask pock
```
Then, download and open the `oil.zip` file from the releases. Navigate to the status bar and select "Pock > Install Widget". Choose the `oil.pock` that came from the zip file. With all that done, you should be able to see the widget within the pock customization panel when you select "Pock > Customize Pock". 

Additionally, the preferences panel in "Pock > Manage Widget" offers useful options if you would like to change the look of the widget.
